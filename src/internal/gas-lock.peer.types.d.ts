/**
 * Ambient declarations for gas-lock, consumed as a peer subtree package.
 *
 * gas-lock is expected as a runtime global (Apps Script has no module
 * system); this file declares its public surface so a consuming package can
 * typecheck standalone via `tsc --noEmit` without vendoring the source.
 *
 * Canonical copy: gas-lock/peer/gas-lock.peer.types.d.ts. Do not edit
 * downstream copies — update the canonical file and re-copy, so every peer
 * stays in step with the published surface.
 *
 * Being a `.d.ts`, this file is type-only: it matches a consumer's
 * `include: ["src/**\/*.ts"]` but emits nothing, so no counterpart reaches
 * dist/ or the published package.
 *
 * Usage: copy into the consuming package as `src/internal/`.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/yorsh-co/gas-lock
 * @version 1.0.0
